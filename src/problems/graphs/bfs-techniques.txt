Why BFS always found shortest path:
The very first time a node is discovered (unvisited node), its distance from the root node will always be shortest.
For example we have a root and it has 3 neighbors , root to those neigbors have distance 1 and the same idea applies recursively for all undiscovered node.

Types of BFS: 

Standard BFS
BFS from borders: starting from the edges of the matrix
0-1 BFS
Multi-source BFS
BFS with Bitmasking/state [revisit same node but with different information ]
Bidirectional BFS
